# WebGrub Launcher

Grub-like Standalone Websites Disambiguation Page
-
A completely useless but cool standalone PHP web page in a shape of a developer puppy: the old-school, beloved-by-many, GRUB interface. 

Objective
-
Have you ever ended up with multiple websites in the same /var/www/ folder? How do you allow people to chose what website to visit? I can hear your voice roaming: "virtual servers configuration!". But what if you can't do that because the web-host you chose is super-cheap and you don't want to spend any extra money? Well, you free up your creativity and put a fancy index page in front of everything that shows you a clickable list of your hosted websites.

Features
-
- Retro-style webpage (indeed, [GRUB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_GRUB)-like).
- List all the sibling folders as clickable links.
- List all the sibling files that contains a browser link: typically those bookmark files created by browsers.
- Accessible with both mouse and keyword.
- Geeky and Cool!

Installation
-
The project is a single index.php page with everything needed inside. Under the hood it uses PHP, JQuery, Boostrap and Google fonts but you don't really need to worry about it, just copy-paste the index.php in your apache or nginx /var/www/ folder at it should just work.

Demo

This little project was ideated, designed and implemented by me, in a boring covid-19 evening at home. I hope you can enjoy it as much as I do!

Long life and prosperity \\\\//_
